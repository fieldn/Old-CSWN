		<p><b>The Computer Science Women's Network (CSWN) is an organization at 
			<a href="http://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> 
			consisting of people (both students and staff) who are dedicated to helping women 
			in the computer science (CS) field. The leadership team that organizes most activities 
			is made up of female students who want to reach out and help all of the women in CS.
		</b></p>

		<p><b>CSWN organizes different activities meant to encourage young women 
			to meet one another and also learn more about their chosen field of study. 
			These activities range from picnics to technical talks to helping students 
			find tutors if they are needed.
		</b></p>

		<p><b>Our goal is to encourage women in computer science to stay in the field and prosper.
